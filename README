Repo for working through the Princeton algorithms course by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

Need to include the algorithms java library stuff. I already modified the scripts in the
bin directory to work on my NixOS install, so I renamed the dir to mybin. Keep that version
and delete the bin that comes with lift-cli.

`````
cd external
sudo curl -O "https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/linux/lift-cli.zip"
unzip lift-cli.zip
rm lift-cli.zip
rm bin
````
